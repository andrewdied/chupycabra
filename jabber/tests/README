Many tests need to be put here.  My original thought is to use unittest,
since it's "batteries included" in python, and I'm sure people use it
successfully.  Also, one of the end goals of chupycabra is for regular
users (IT and QA people, say), to be able to understand it and use it
quickly, tests are a good starting point for users.
